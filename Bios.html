        <p class="text">For over 22 years, I&rsquo;ve shared my life with my beloved wife and submissive, TheGirl_Star. From the very beginning, our marriage has been rooted in Kink and power exchangeâ€”long before we ever stepped into the larger kink community.</p>
        <p class="text">Through the House of Xanadu, I offer friendship and mentorship, providing structured guidance to those seeking deeper, more intentional power exchange. I am committed to cultivating a space where individuals and dynamics can learn, grow, and explore this lifestyle with safety, wisdom, and mutual support.</p>
        <p class="text">I lead with honor, and believe in building legaciesâ€”one protocol, one ritual, one meaningful connection at a time.</p>

        <p class="text">A passionate educator, and devoted submissive. I have spent years as a special education teacher, and brought that same love of structure, patience, and teaching into everything I do now.</p>
        <p class="text">Alongside my Daddy and husband of 22 years, I&rsquo;ve immersed myself in the study and practice of High Protocol. We&rsquo;ve attended countless classes, intensives, and events.</p>
        <p class="text">I love teaching others, especially when it comes to blending tradition with fun. I do it with heart, intention, and a whole lot of glitter. ðŸ’–âœ¨</p>
